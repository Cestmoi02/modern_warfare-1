<b>Game Story</b><br>
<b>As Russia masses troops at the border with the Ukraine, the West slowly begins mobilization preparations. Russia, believing the only way to successfully contain NATO is to launch a surprise strike on the entire eastern flank of the NATO alliance, launches a full-scale invasion of Europe. As NATO troops scramble to defend its members, there are worries that the war might escalate to a true global war, with actors such as China and the Arab League overtly supporing the Russian invasion. Other smaller actors are also expected to join a side sooner or later, bringing war to the world on a scale never seen before. Will NATO regain its strength, bolstered by the US Rapid Deployment Force combined with the massive mobilization of EU reserves and contain the Russian advance, or will the unlikely allies of Russia save the day by diverting enough resources from the allied response to make it possible to Russia to quickly take over Europe?</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Game Premises and Scale</b><br>
<br>The orders of battle are mostly Wikipedia, with each ground unit representing 1 Brigade for superpowers, 2-4 brigades for minor countries, depending on their inefficiency or corruption or sometimes simply for balance. Every air unit is about 100 planes/attack helicopters, every destroyer, submarine and transport unit is about 6-8 ships, a cruiser unit is about 2-4 cruisers, maybe with escort, and a carrier or a battleship is 1-2 capital ships with some small escorts. There are some sacrifices which had to be made in order to make an entertaining game. There is no evidence that the Arab League would ever dream to team up with Russia and conquer the world, or that Serbia might be persuaded to join the Russian camp by a quick enough victory. Brazil and Mexico scenarios are more of a what-if than a prediction or a real posibility. To beef up the income of the Commonwealth and the Arab League, concessions had to be made regarding which territories they occupy: I am fully aware that Pakistan and Iran are not members of the AL, and I doubt any countries in Africa would side with the Commonwealth in a war that irrelevant for them. In other words, the world described here is rather a perfect storm which would lead to a World War never seen before, which would be horrible, but makes for an interesting what-if Axis-and-Allies style game. Take it as an apocalyptical scenario which is gamable and which hopefully will never happen in the real world. <br>
<br>
<b>Game Rules</b><br>
<br> The rules are mostly Axis and Allies Global 2nd Edition, with some important differences<br>
<br> Every faction has 2 AAA default "techs", in order to enable some game mechanics: Rockets (to enable Submarines, Cruisers and Missile Launchers to launch missiles) and Paratroopers (To enable Cargo Planes to airlift troops)<br>
<br> Rockets have a range of 2 and a damage threshold of 1-6.<br>
<br> Battles last 1 turn. If at the end of a battle both sides still have units in the territory, the territory becomes contested and its PU production is frozen. It can still mobilize units for the owner of the factory<br>
<br> Before a battle, a new step has been introduced: the Air Supremacy Step. All planes (not helicopters) fight 1 round air battle. These units then participate normally in battle afterwards. Can be disabled from Map Options<br>
<br> Air Units may scramble from air bases <b>in any region</b> around its base.<br>
<br> Factories may take 2x territory production as damage and can mobilize as many units as the production value of the territory allows<br>
<br> Factories, Airbases, Harbours, Missile Launchers and Fortifications may be bombed. Except Factories, all instalations, upon reaching max operational damage, cease to function. Factories work like in AAA 42: each point of damage reduces its production capacity by 1, up to a max of 2x territory value damage.<br>
<br> Every Capital produces 1 Diplomacy Point per turn, which may be used to influence other countries or augument your forces during the Operations Step of the turn, just before the Purchase Step. Every action costs either 1 or 2 DPs, and its effects may be found in the tables below.<br>
<br> Victory Condition: The Russia Alliance must have 18 Victory Cities at the end of a Commonwealth turn. The NATO Alliance must have 26 Victory Cities at the end of a Commonwealth turn.<br>
<br> <br>
<br> If you want the AI to "use" the User Actions, tick the (faction) is AI option in Map Options. (it activates special AI triggers in order for them to be able to deploy the Rapid Reaction Forces or to convince countries to join them)<br>
